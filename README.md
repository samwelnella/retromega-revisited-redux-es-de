# Retro Mega (Revisited) for ES-DE

This is port of the Reto Mega theme (originally designed & created by [djfumberger](https://fumberger.com/) for Pegasus Frontend) to ES-DE.

I primarily translated the layout to be usable in the theming engine for ES-DE.  Please refer to the `Changes Made` section below for additional details. The original version of the theme for Pegasus can be found [here](https://github.com/djfumberger/retromega).

## Changes Made

- Translated and rewrote all Pegasus specific aspects to make the theme compatible with ES-DE.
  - ES-DE's theming engine does not share the same feature set as Pegasus so some aspects needed to be removed (e.g. drop shadows, navigation flow, some animations)
- Replaced controller graphics with the artwork set created by [Pineapple Graphics](https://www.instagram.com/pineapple.graphics/).
  - The original artwork created by djfumberger is amazing, however it had a smaller scope of coverage. Moving to the set from Pineapple Graphics enabled a larger set of systems to be implemented while keeping a consistent aesthetic.
- Updated system names to match the standard used by ES-DE
- Added images & color schemes for additional systems supported by ES-DE
- Embedded the ES-DE [system-metadata](https://gitlab.com/es-de/themes/system-metadata) repository to power color details
